1. inside a loop we initialize i as a first index of string & i as a last index of string.
2. i will be incriment and j will be decreament in every iteration.
3. in every iteration cracter of index i & cracter of index j will be checked.
4. if not equal thn we will update palindrome value as a false.

5. if every character is match thn palindrome will be remain true.
